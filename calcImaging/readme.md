## It's a start (12/19/2018)
This Pipeline component aims at extending the Talon framework to a new recording modality: calcium imaging with
implantable fluorescent miniscopes. The general analysis approach is (at this stage) largely a hack and re-write of
code developed by W Liberti, N Perkins, D Leman, and a few other folks. S Allen did the first big pass at making this
conversion; T. Otchy is currently the main developer (until I can rope someone else in to do this)... Until there is a
publication reporting this, consider it very much a beta version.
